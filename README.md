# Fussee
Fussee is a website specifically tailored towards fussy eaters and people that suffer with food allergies and intolerence. Simply search for ingredients that you would and would NOT like to eat and Fussee will return recipes for you that match your search criteria. The website includes a user system that allows the user to favourite recipes and has privileges allowing admin accounts to perform administrative actions such as adding new recipes to the database etc.

Fussee was originally created as my final year project for my Bachelor's Degree but I've decided to actively work on it whilst I'm searching for employment. The front-end is currently being redesigned using Bootstrap.
